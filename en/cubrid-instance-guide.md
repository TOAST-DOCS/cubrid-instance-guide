## Create a CUBRID Instance

To use CUBRID, you must first create an instance.

![cubrid_instance_image_1.jpg](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_cubrid_instance/cubrid_instance_image_1.jpg)

Click the **Create** button in **Create CUBRID Instance** to go to **Compute > Instance > Create Instance**.

The following two types of CUBRID version are provided.

![cubrid_instance_image_2.jpg](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_cubrid_instance/cubrid_instance_image_2.jpg)

* CUBRID 10.2.4
    * CUBRID-10.2.4.8884-d6808c1-Linux.x86\_64.rpm
* CUBRID 11.0.2
    * CUBRID-11.0.2.0291-a507059-Linux.x86\_64.rpm

Select a CUBRID image and complete additional setup to create an instance. For more information on instance creation, see [Instance Overview](http://docs.toast.com/en/Compute/Instance/en/overview/).

After the instance creation is complete, use SSH to access the instance.
The instance must have an associated floating IP and TCP port 22 (SSH) must be allowed in the security group.

Connect to the instance using an SSH client and the configured key pair.
For a detailed guide on SSH connection, refer to [SSH Connection Guide](https://docs.toast.com/en/Compute/Instance/en/overview/#how-to-access-linux-instances).

## How to Start/Stop the CUBRID service

You can start or stop the CUBRID service as follows by logging in with the “cubrid” Linux account.
```
# Start the CUBRID service/server
shell> sudo su - cubrid
shell> cubrid service start 
shell> cubrid server start demodb

# Stop the CUBRID service/server
shell> sudo su - cubrid
shell> cubrid server stop demodb
shell> cubrid service stop 

# Restart the CUBRID service/server
shell> sudo su - cubrid
shell> cubrid server restart demodb
shell> cubrid service restart 

# Start/stop/restart the CUBRID broker
shell> sudo su - cubrid
shell> cubrid broker start
shell> cubrid broker stop
shell> cubrid broker restart
```

## Connect to CUBRID

After creating an instance, initially connect as follows.
```
shell> sudo su - cubrid
shell> csql -u dba demodb@localhost
```

## Initial Setup After Creating a CUBRID Instance

### 1\. Set the Password

After initial installation, the CUBRID dba account password is not set. Therefore, you must set a password after installation.
```
shell> csql -u dba -c "ALTER USER dba PASSWORD 'new_password'" demodb@localhost
```

### 2\. Change the Broker Port

The broker port for **query_editor** defaults to **30000**, and the broker port for **broker1** defaults to **33000**.
For security reasons, it is recommended to change the port.

##### 1) Modify the broker file

Open the following file and enter the port address to change as shown below.
```
shell> vi /opt/cubrid/conf/cubrid_broker.conf

[%query_editor]
BROKER_PORT             =[port address to change]

[%BROKER1]
BROKER_PORT             =[port address to change]
```

##### 2) Restart the broker

Restart the broker for the port change to take effect.
```
shell> cubrid broker restart
```

### 2\. Change the Manager Server Port

The manager server port defaults to **8001**.
For security reasons, it is recommended to change the port.

##### 1)  Modify the cm.conf file

Open the following file and enter the port address to change as shown below.
```
shell> vi /opt/cubrid/conf/cm.conf

cm_port =[port address to change]
```

##### 2) Restart the manager server

Restart the manager for the port change to take effect.
```
shell> cubrid manager stop
shell> cubrid manager start
```
